# Node.js: The Complete Guide to Build RESTful APIs

## Learn to build fast, scalable and secure RESTful services with Node, Express and MongoDB, from setup to production



**What is Node.js?**

Node.js, or Node, is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a browser. It is ideal for building highly-scalable, data-intensive backend services (APIs) that power your client’s apps (web or mobile apps).



**Why learn Node?**

Node is great for prototyping and agile development as well as building super fast and highly scalable apps; Companies like Uber and PayPal use Node in production to build applications because it requires fewer people and less code. Plus, Node has the largest ecosystem of open-source library, so you don’t have to build everything from scratch.
